            <p>
                I have been working in the domain of graph-based machine learning (graph neural networks) since 2022.
                I am currently working on large graph classification and its application in identifying organized campaigns on Twitter.
                Previously, as a part of my MS, I had worked on graph augmentation using spectral methods to improve classification performance.

                I am currently looking for internships related to graph-based machine learning for Summer 2025.
                I am comfortable working in Python, Java, C/C++, and ML libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow (and its graph ML extensions).
