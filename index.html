                My research aims to devise new classification methods for computational social science applications. 
                In this regard, I design and develop new models and algorithms based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) 
                that are targeted for real-world problems in complex network data such as detecting coordinated campaigns in social media.

                I am currently looking for internships related to graph-based machine learning for Summer 2025.
                I am comfortable working in Python, Java, C/C++, and ML libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow (and its graph ML extensions).
