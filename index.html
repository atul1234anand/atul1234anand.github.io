	<h1>Hi there, I'm Atul!</h1>
	<p>
	I have been working in the domain of graph based machine learning(graph neural networks) since 2022.
	I am currently working on large graph classification and it's application in identifying organized campaigns on Twitter.
	Previously, as a part of MS I had worked on graph augmentation using spectral methods to improve classification performance.

	<p>
	I am currently looking for internships related to graph based machine learning for Summer 2025.
	I am comfortable working in Python, Java, C/C++ and ML libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow (and it's graph ML extensions).
	</p>
